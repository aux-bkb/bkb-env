====== gpg-and-gpg-agent ======
Created Wednesday 21 December 2016

the combination or fish shell and gpg-agent is constant source of frustration

also it doesn't interest me. so I always throw some commands around until it works. something among the lines of

keychain --nogui --clear 
  keychain --eval   --quiet -Q ~/.ssh/auxsend_acer.rsa 35827ADE
  keychain --quiet --nogui ~/.ssh/auxsend_acer.rsa 35827ADE
