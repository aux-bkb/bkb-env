-X11: Xdefaults vs Xressources


From what understand it is not so much the name that differes, but the way the values are read:

- the OLD way: each program loads '~/.Xresources' at startup

- the new way: the new program 'xrdb' loads a config file once and then the values are available for all programs. The config files is named by convention '~/.Xdefaults', but it can also read an '~/.Xresources file



Xinitrc

~/.xinitrc is loaded by startx, that is executed by desktop environments and window managers. Here we can control 'xrdb'

   [[ -f ~/.Xresources ]] && xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources


Here we force to load the "old" Xresources file instead of Xdefaults
