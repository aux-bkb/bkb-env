-- In Safari, this copies the Title and URL of the current tab to the clipboard.  
-- Save the script in ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari
-- Using QuickSilver, I assign a trigger to this script using the hotkey ⌥-C (option c), with the scope of the trigger limited to Safari.
-- Inspired by CopyURL + (http://copyurlplus.mozdev.org/)
