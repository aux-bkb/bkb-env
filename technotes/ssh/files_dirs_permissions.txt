# SSH: Files, Dirs and Permissions




chmod 0750 ~/    # yeah thats the (questionable) convention

   chmod 700 ~/.ssh 
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*

   chmod 0644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   chmod 0644 ~/.ssh/known_hosts


on the server:

   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 

   chmod 700 ~/.ssh/


Note: if this is not correctly set, one error might be that the keys are not recognized (loaded)(k
