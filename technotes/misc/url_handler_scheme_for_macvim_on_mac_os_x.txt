9. mvim:// URL handler    *mvim://* *macvim-url-handler*  

MacVim supports a custom URL handler for "mvim://" URLs. The handler is supposed to be compatible to TextMate's URL scheme as documented at >  http://blog.macromates.com/2007/the-textmate-url-scheme/.  
Currently, this means that the format is 

>  mvim://open?<arguments> 

where "arguments" can be: 
 * url — the actual file to open (i.e. a file://... URL), if you leave   out this argument, the frontmost document is implied  
 * * line — line number to go to (one based)  
 * * column — column number to go to (one based) 
 
  For example, the link 
  
  	>  mvim://open?url=file:///etc/profile&line=20 
  	
  		will open the file /etc/profile on line 20 when clicked in a web browser.  Note that url has to be a file:// url pointing to an existing local file.
