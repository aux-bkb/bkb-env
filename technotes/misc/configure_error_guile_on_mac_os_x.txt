Errors:

checking for LIBFFI... configure: error: Package requirements (libffi) were not met:

No package 'libffi' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables LIBFFI_CFLAGS
and LIBFFI_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.



Error 2:
checking for BDW_GC... configure: error: Package requirements (bdw-gc) were not met:

No package 'bdw-gc' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables BDW_GC_CFLAGS
and BDW_GC_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

Solutions:

find /usr -iname '*libffi*' | grep pc
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/libffi.pc

on my mac os x 8.6:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/Cellar/libffi/3.0.10/lib/pkgconfig
