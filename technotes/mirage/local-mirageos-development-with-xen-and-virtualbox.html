Local MirageOS development with Xen and Virtualbox {#local-mirageos-development-with-xen-and-virtualbox .entry-title}
==================================================

Mon 19 January 2015


[MirageOS](http://www.openmirage.org) is a library operating system. An
application written for MirageOS is compiled to an operating system
kernel that only contains the specific functionality required by the
application - a [unikernel](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628).
The MirageOS unikernels can be compiled for different targets, including
standalone VMs that run under Xen. The Xen unikernels can be deployed
directly to common cloud services such as [Amazon
EC2](http://openmirage.org/wiki/xen-boot) and
[Linode](http://christopherbothwell.com/ocaml/mirage/linode/2014/12/08/hello-linode.html).

I have done a lot of MirageOS development for Xen lately and it can be
inconvenient to have to rely on an external server or service to be able
to run and debug the unikernel. As an alternative I have set up a VM in
Virtualbox with a Xen server. The MirageOS unikernels then run as VMs in
Xen, which itself runs in a VM in Virtualbox. With the "Host-only
networking" feature in Virtualbox the unikernels are accessible from the
host operating system, which can be very useful for testing
client/server applications. A unikernel that hosts a web page can for
example be tested in a web browser in the host OS. I am hoping that this
setup may be useful to others so I am documenting it in this blog post.

My current VM is based on [Ubuntu Server 14.04
LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/) with Xen hypervisor 4.4
installed. The steps described in this post should be transferrable to
other distributions if they support newer versions of the Xen hypervisor
(4.4+). I have also included a list of alternative development
environments for Mirage [near the end](#alternatives).

### Install the Ubuntu VM

First, create a new Virtualbox VM with at least 1 GB RAM and 20 GB disk
and start the Ubuntu Server installation. How to install Ubuntu in
Virtualbox is covered in detail
[elsewhere](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ubuntu_as_Guest_OS), so I
will only briefly describe the most relevant steps.

To keep the VM lightweight, install as few features as possible. We will
use SSH to login to the server so select "OpenSSH Server". You may want
to install a desktop environment later, but keep in mind that the
graphics support will be limited under two layers of virtualization
(Virtualbox + Xen).

Give the Linux VM a hostname that is unique on your network as we will
use this to access it with SSH later. I use "virtualxen".

Add a user you want to use for development, for example "mirage".

You may also want to reserve some of the disk space for Mirage if you
plan to run applications that use block storage. During guided
partitioning in the Ubuntu installer, if you choose to use the entire
disk, the next question will allow you to specify a percentage of the
disk that you want to use. If you plan to use Xen VMs that need direct
disk access you should leave some of it for this purpose, for example
50%.

After completing the installation, run apt-get update/upgrade and
install the Virtualbox guest utilities, then reboot:

<div class="highlight">

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils 
    sudo reboot

</div>

### Install the Xen Hypervisor

After installing the Ubuntu Server VM, your configuration will be as in
the following figure. Ubuntu runs in Virtualbox which runs under the
main operating system (OS X in my case).

![](/images/blog/mirage_dev/ubuntu_in_vm_overview.jpg){.center}

We are now going to install the Xen hypervisor, which will become a thin
layer between Virtualbox and the Ubuntu Server installation. The Xen
hypervisor will be able to run VMs within the Virtualbox VM and we can
use the Ubuntu installation to control Xen. This is the new
configuration with Xen:

![](/images/blog/mirage_dev/xen_in_vm_overview.jpg){.center}

[Dom0](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Dom0) is the original Ubuntu Server
installation and the [DomU](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/DomU)'s will be our
future Mirage applications.

To install Xen, log in to Ubuntu and install the Xen hypervisor with the
following command. We will also need bridge-utils (for configuring
networking), build-essential (development tools) and git (version
control):

<div class="highlight">

    # install hypervisor and other tools
    sudo apt-get install xen-hypervisor-4.4-amd64 bridge-utils build-essential git

</div>

After the installation is complete, reboot the Virtualbox VM to start
into Xen and the Ubuntu Server installation (which now has become dom0).

Xen can be controlled from dom0 with the `xl` command. To verify that
Ubuntu is running under Xen, log in and run `sudo xl list` to show a
list of running domains. The output should look similar to this:

<div class="highlight">

    $ sudo xl list
    Name                                        ID   Mem VCPUs       State      Time(s)
    Domain-0                                     0  1896     1      r-----         31.7

</div>

The only Xen domain running at this point should be Dom0.

We are now ready to set up networking.

### Networking

Internet access should work out of the box for dom0, but to enable
network access from the domU's we have set up a bridge device that they
can connect to. We will call this device br0. Since this is a
development environment we also want the unikernels to be accessible
from the host operating system (so we can test them), but not from the
local network. Virtualbox has a feature that allows this called a
host-only network.

To set up the host-only network in Virtualbox we have to shutdown the VM
(`sudo shutdown -h now`). Then go to Preferences in Virtualbox and
select the "Network" tab and "Host-only Networks". Create a new network.
Make sure that the built-in DHCP server is disabled - I have not managed
to get the built-in DHCP server to work with Mirage, so we will install
a DHCP server in dom0 instead. If you already have an existing host-only
network and you disabled the DHCP server in this step, remember to
restart Virtualbox to make sure that the DHCP server is not running.

After setting up the host-only network, exit preferences and open the
settings for the VM. Under the "Network" tab, go to "Adapter 2", enable
it and choose to attach to "Host-only Adapter". Select the name of the
network that you just created in Preferences. Under advanced, select
"Allow All" for "Promiscuous mode". Exit and save.

You can now start the VM with the new network configuration. After
booting, edit /etc/network/interfaces to setup up the host-only adapter
(eth1) and add it to the bridge (br0). The configuration below is based
on the default IP range (192.168.56.x) for host-only networking in
Virtualbox - if you have made changes to the default network
configuration you may have to update the configuration here as well.

<div class="highlight">

    # /etc/network/interfaces
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet dhcp

    auto eth1
    iface eth1 inet manual
        pre-up ifconfig $IFACE up
        post-down ifconfig $IFACE down

    auto br0
    iface br0 inet static
        bridge_ports eth1
        address 192.168.56.5
        broadcast 192.168.56.255
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        # disable ageing (turn bridge into switch)
        up /sbin/brctl setageing br0 0
        # disable stp
        up /sbin/brctl stp br0 off

</div>

Next, we install dnsmasq to setup a DHCP server in dom0. This DHCP
server will be responsible for assigning IP addresses to the unikernels
that attach to br0.

<div class="highlight">

    $ sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

</div>

To enable the DHCP server on br0, edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf and add the
following lines:

<div class="highlight">

    interface=br0
    dhcp-range=192.168.56.150,192.168.56.200,1h

</div>

This configures the DHCP server to run on br0 and to dynamically assign
IP addresses in the range 192.168.56.150 to 192.168.56.200 with a lease
time of 1 hour.

To be able to access dom0 via SSH from the host operating system
(outside Virtualbox) we install avahi-daemon. Avahi-daemon enables mDNS,
which will allow you to connect to "virtualxen.local" from the host
operating system:

<div class="highlight">

    $ sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon

</div>

Reboot dom0 to activate the changes (`sudo reboot`).

You should now be able to connect to dom0 with SSH from the host OS:

<div class="highlight">

    $ ssh mirage@virtualxen.local

</div>

Dom0 can also be accessed from the host by using the IP address for br0
that we set above: 192.168.56.5.

### Installing MirageOS in dom0

Before we can compile MirageOS unikernels we have to install OCaml.

<div class="highlight">

    # install ocaml and friends
    sudo apt-get install ocaml-compiler-libs ocaml-interp ocaml-base-nox ocaml-base ocaml ocaml-nox ocaml-native-compilers camlp4 camlp4-extra m4

</div>

We also need the OCaml package manager, [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org).
A new version of opam was recently release and the version that comes
with many Linux distros is outdated. To get the latest version
(currently 1.2.x) I use [0install](http://0install.net) to install opam
directly from the installation script provided on the ocaml.org web
page. If you don't want to use 0install, a list of other options is
available [here](http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) (including
PPA's).

<div class="highlight">

    # install 0install
    sudo apt-get install zeroinstall-injector
    # install opam
    0install add opam http://tools.ocaml.org/opam.xml

</div>

0install installs applications in \~/bin. To add this directory to your
path logout and back in.

After installing opam, run `opam init` and follow the instructions to
complete the installation. Note that the opam commands should not be run
with sudo, as it installs everything in \~/.opam in your home directory.

If you want to run the development version of Mirage, you can add
mirage-dev as an opam repository. Keep in mind that this repository
contains the latest changes to Mirage, which may not always work. *The
safest option is to skip this step*.

<div class="highlight">

    # optional - add mirage-dev to opam 
    opam remote add mirage-dev git://github.com/mirage/mirage-dev

</div>

We can now install Mirage:

<div class="highlight">

    # install libs required to build many mirage apps
    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev pkg-config
    # install mirage
    opam install mirage -v

</div>

After Mirage has been installed you should be able to run the Mirage
configuration tool `mirage`.

<div class="highlight">

    $ mirage --version
    2.0.0

</div>

If you use emacs or vim I also recommend installing
[Merlin](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/wiki), which
provides tab completion, type lookup and many other useful IDE features
for OCaml.

### Creating a Mirage VM

To verify that everything works, we will now download the [Mirage
examples](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton) and compile the
static website example. This example will start a web server hosting a
"Hello world" page that we should be able to access from the host OS.
The IP-address will be assigned with DHCP.

First, clone the Mirage examples:

<div class="highlight">

    # clone mirage-skeleton
    git clone http://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton.git

</div>

Then go to the `mirage-skeleton/static-webpage` folder and run
`env DHCP=true mirage configure --xen`. This command will download and
install all the required dependencies and then create a Makefile. When
the command completes, run `make` to compile.

If make completes successfully, there will be a file called `www.xl`
that contains the Xen DomU configuration file for the unikernel. By
default the line that contains the network interface configuration is
commented out. Remove the \# in front of the line that begins with 'vif
= ...' to enable network support. The `www.xl` file should look similar
to this:

<div class="highlight">

    name = 'www'
    kernel = '/home/mirage/mirage-skeleton/static_website/mir-www.xen'
    builder = 'linux'
    memory = 256
    on_crash = 'preserve'

    # You must define the network and block interfaces manually.

    # The disk configuration is defined here:
    # http://xenbits.xen.org/docs/4.3-testing/misc/xl-disk-configuration.txt
    # An example would look like:
    # disk = [ '/dev/loop0,,xvda' ]

    # The network configuration is defined here:
    # http://xenbits.xen.org/docs/4.3-testing/misc/xl-network-configuration.html
    # An example would look like:
    vif = [ 'mac=c0:ff:ee:c0:ff:ee,bridge=br0' ]

</div>

The memory is set to 256 MB by default, but most of the example
unikernels require much less than this. The static webserver example
runs fine with 16 MB.

You should now be able to start the unikernel using the command
`sudo xl create www.xl -c`:

<div class="highlight">

</div>

The console output shows the IP address that was assigned to the
unikernel ("DHCP offer received and bound..."). In the example above the
IP is 192.168.56.178. From the host operating system you should now be
able to open this IP in a web browser to see the "Hello Mirage World!"
message.

If you login to dom0 in a new terminal `xl list` will show the running
domains, which now includes "www":

<div class="highlight">

    $ sudo xl list
    Name                                        ID   Mem VCPUsStateTime(s)
    Domain-0                                     0  1355     1     r-----    6691.4
    www                                         33   256     1     -b----       0.2

</div>

To stop the unikernel, run `sudo xl destroy www`.

### [Some alternatives]()

The environment described in this post is my current development
environment and is based on a Xen server running in a Virtualbox VM with
the latest versions of opam and Mirage. I use a host-only second network
adapter to allow access to the Mirage applications from the host running
Virtualbox.

Mirage applications can also be compiled in [Unix
mode](http://openmirage.org/wiki/hello-world), which produces an
executable that can be executed directly in a Unix-like operating
system. Currently OS X seems to be particularly well supported. This
mode may often be the easiest way to debug and develop a Mirage
application, but not all of Mirage's features are available in this mode
and some applications may require low level access to the system - for
example to block storage or network interfaces - which may not be
available in this mode.

Another approach is to use a [Cubieboard2](http://cubieboard.org) with a
prebuilt [Mirage/Xen image](http://github.com/mirage/xen-arm-builder) to
set up a low cost, portable Xen server for development. If you want to
have long running Mirage services in your local network or host your own
web page this may be a good alternative. Note that compilation times can
be slow on this platform compared to an x86 based VM.

An automated VM setup is being developed based on Debian, Vagrant and
Packer [here](http://github.com/mirage/mirage-vagrant-vms). This can be
useful if you don't want to manually perform the setup steps outlined in
this post. Currently this setup uses an older version of Debian which
comes with Xen 4.1, but it should be possible to upgrade to Debian
Jessie or later.
