Mount Webdav on Linux
=====================




There where some difficulties with mounting Webfdav in linux. Basically 3 settings play together:

- installing davfs2
- configuring davfs2
- setup security of davfs2
- configuring fstab
- configuring groups
- setup mount point

Mounting a WebDAV directory in Linux (Ubuntu)
---------------------------------------------

In this way you don't need to use terminal all the time to mount/umount a WebDav directory as nautilus  can be used easily. The steps are as follows.

### Install davfs2

	sudo apt-get install davfs2

### Reconfigure davfs2 to enable to use davfs under unprivileged users

	sudo dpkg-reconfigure davfs2

### Edit /etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf to enable automatic credentials use. 

Uncomment the line secrets ~/.davfs2/secrets

### Edit ~/.davfs2/secrets file to add credentials to remote WebDav diectory.

Add a line to the end of file in following style:

	https://<WebDav URI>   <username> <password>

Set the permission: 

	chmod 600 ~/.davfs2/secrets

### Add a line to /ect/fstab about the remote WebDav directory

	https://<WebDav URI> <mount point> davfs user,noauto,file_mode=600,dir_mode=700 0 1

### Add your user to the davfs2 group

	sudo vi /etc/group
Add your username as follows:

	davfs2:x:134:<username>

That's it. You can use following commands without being a root user to mount/umount

# mount <mount point>
# umount <mount point>
You can also use nautilus to mount/umount the directory.
